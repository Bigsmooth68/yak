# YaK

Get complete control of your hybrid cloud infrastructure with little expertise. YaK deploys and configures your machines across any public cloud providers and on-premise in the same predictable way.

YaK Community is backed by [dbi-services](http://dbi-services.com). Start free with an open-source license and extend your powers anytime with components to operate third-party software: Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc. More information on http://dbi-services.com/en/yak/components.

## Principles

- **No lock-in:** YaK is and will stay entirely open-source.
- **Extensible:** add any cloud providers.
- **Modular:** add components to operate any third-party software (Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc).
- **Simple:** most effortless IT cross cloud provider automation system ever.
- **Powerful:** Automate your operations in parallel on cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and OCI.
- **Maintainability:** Based on Ansible and fallback on Python when necessary.
